# Baseball and python
My little-more-than-casual but not-very-wonky statistical look at the current Chicago baseball season using python, the pybaseball package package by James LeDoux and the Python charting package called Seaborn.

Pybaseball can be found here: https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball
